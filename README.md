*   **Relevance:** Demonstrates capabilities in complex statistical modeling, probabilistic simulation, and data-driven problem-solving, applicable in diverse data science domains.

## Data Visualization

### Overview
In my journey as a data scientist, I've always been fascinated by the power of visualization in storytelling. My recent endeavors have been focused on dynamic visualization and interactive dashboards. These platforms empower users to customize their data views while maintaining the integrity of the overarching narrative. This approach not only enhances user engagement but also ensures that key insights are effectively communicated.

### Projects and Exploration
While I have a wealth of experience in static data visualization, my recent projects have been exploratory ventures into dynamic visualization using D3 and React in JavaScript. These projects are part of my learning journey and may not reflect the professional standards of my other work, but they showcase my growing interest and capabilities in this exciting area of data science.
